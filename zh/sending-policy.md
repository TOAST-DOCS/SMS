## Monthly Sending Volume Limit
* The SMS service has a monthly sending limit.
* SMS sending volume is initially limited to 5,000 messages per month per organization. If you need to adjust your sending volume, contact [Customer Center](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/support/inquiry).
  * Restriction Targets

  1) If SMS is first enabled in a project within an organization after September 10, 2024, the sending volume limit applies to that organization.
  2) If SMS was enabled in a project within an organization before September 10, 2024, that organization is excluded from the sending volume limit.


* The sending limit is the total number of messages sent, regardless of SMS/LMS/MMS/International SMS type.
* Monthly sending quotas and usage can be viewed in the [Console > Organization > Project > Quota Management] menu. Go to [(https://docs.nhncloud.com/ko/nhncloud/ko/resource-policy/#sms)Resource Provision Policy Guide](https://docs.nhncloud.com/en/nhncloud/en/resource-policy/#sms).
* Because the sending count is based on successful deliveries, successful deliveries are counted even if the device fails to receive them.

## Guide to Sending Speed Depending on the Size of MMS Attachments
+ When sending MMS, there may be a difference in the sending speed depending on the size of the attachments.
+ The larger the size of uploaded attachments is, the slower the sending speed and the update of reception result may become due to carrier's sending speed restrictions.
+ If you want faster delivery, we recommend that you make a request by reducing the size of attachments.

## Guide to sending contents according to character set
+ When received, messages included in EUC-KR normally appear the same as the contents sent.
+ When characters not included in EUC-KR are included in the title/body, the contents may appear as broken characters such as '?'.
    + Depending on the type of receiving device and carrier, the contents of the message may appear differently.

## Timeout Policy for Message Receiving Result
+ Depending on the device and communication status, there may be a delay in updating message receiving results.
+ In case of delay in receiving messages, delivery is attempted according to the NHN Cloud resending policy.
+ The resending policy is as follows.

| Send Type | Timeout duration | After Timeout |
|---|---|---|
| SMS | 25 hour | Do not retry. Update of receive failure result (Result code: 2000) |
| LMS | 80 hour | Do not retry. Update of receive failure result (Result code: 2000) |
| MMS | 80 hour | Do not retry. Update of receive failure result (Result code: 2000) |
