## Guide to Sending Speed Depending on the Size of MMS Attachments
+ When sending MMS, there may be a difference in the sending speed depending on the size of the attachments.
+ The larger the size of uploaded attachments is, the slower the sending speed and the update of reception result may become due to carrier's sending speed restrictions.
+ If you want faster delivery, we recommend that you make a request by reducing the size of attachments.

## Guide to sending contents according to character set
+ When received, messages included in EUC-KR normally appear the same as the contents sent.
+ When characters not included in EUC-KR are included in the title/body, the contents may appear as broken characters such as '?'.
    + Depending on the type of receiving device and carrier, the contents of the message may appear differently.
