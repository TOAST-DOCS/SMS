## Guide to Sending International SMS Messages
+ When sending international SMS messages, please check the following key points.
### Country-specific Sender ID Policy
+ International SMS messages are sent according to country-specific sender ID policies and may be treated as spam if you do not follow the policies.
+ The sending number set by the customer is not guaranteed to be exposed on the receiving device. In most cases, the messages are sent after changing the sending number to a random number in order to send international SMS messages normally.

### Sending Policy
+ In countries with strict international SMS message policies such as China and Vietnam, messages can be sent normally only if the content of the sending message is a verification number (OTP).
+ To send messages properly, it is recommended to enter the verification number (OTP) as follows. (Example: Your verification code is 00000)
+ If you wish to send marketing messages, please contact the [Customer Center](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/support/inquiry) in advance.
+ To send international SMS messages normally, phrases of up to 12 characters may be added to messages according to country-specific policies, and the phrases are included in the number of charged characters.
+ Overseas carriers generally only keep sending logs within 7 days, so it may be difficult to confirm the cause of non-receipt depending on the time of inquiry.
+ It may take some time to confirm the cause of non-receipt through overseas carriers, and may be difficult to determine the exact cause.
+ Transmission quality by country is affected by the network and infrastructure environment in that country and may differ from the domestic environment.

### Billing Policy
+ International SMS messages are charged based on successful data transmission from overseas carriers.
+ The device reception result means the success of data transmission to the overseas communication service provider, and may differ from the actual device reception result. Even if the actual user did not receive the message, it may still count towards billing.
+ International SMS can send long messages through the concat feature. In the case of a long message, you will be charged for the number of messages sent based on character count.
+ When concating messages, the number of characters is reduced while processing headers. 
+ The number of characters and concat standards follow the international SMS standards.
+ Even if the message is sent by concat, it may be received by the device in the form of several short messages rather than a long message, depending on the mobile carrier and device policy.
+ The number of charges per message can be checked with the messageCount field of the detailed inquiry from the console and the detailed inquiry api.
