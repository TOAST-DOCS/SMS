```
ㆍIf a message is sent from falsified sender number, such circuit or service of the user shall be suspended until investigation on the corresponding issue is completed.
  (Nevertheless, if such falsification turns out to be made by mistake, without malicious purposes, service may be resumed upon user's calling and evaluation.)
ㆍService shall be restricted if the user's system is designed to send messages also from other numbers, as well as registered sender numbers.
ㆍDamages shall be claimed for all other losses incurred out of sender number falsification

## Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers
The 'Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers' service protects user's own phone number from potentially spoofed for criminal acts or spamming.

+ As a free service provided by each telecommunication provider (e.g. SKT, KT, LGU+, or MVNO providers), it only requires your agreement to get registered.
+ If your text delivery is confirmed as 'Failure' on the website, even after it is sent to an appropriate number, see if your 'Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers' service is enabled.
+ Disable 'Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers' first, and then try sending your message.
+ It takes about 7 days to get disabled after it is applied.

### Unsubscribing 080 Numbers

+ Ads must be sent along with how to unsubscribe for free, so that recipients can reject or withdraw consent to receiving ads, without a charge.
### Please Check
+ Charges for Unsubscribe 080 Numbers are not based on the delivery time, but upon the public release of each number (monthly fixed charges).
+ It takes about 3 to 4 days to get a new number for unsubscription, so one-off or repetitive service cancellation or application is not recommended.
+ Please note that a service opening cannot be cancelled while registration is reserved.
+ If you want to use the registered 080 call rejection number in other projects, you can use the **Share the blocked 080 phone numbers** feature.
+ 080 numbers that are cancelled from unsubscription or applied externally, delivery shall fail.

## Guide to Sending International SMS Messages
+ When sending international SMS messages, please check the following key points.
### Country-specific Sender ID Policy
+ International SMS messages are sent according to country-specific sender ID policies and may be treated as spam if you do not follow the policies.
+ The sending number set by the customer is not guaranteed to be exposed on the receiving device. In most cases, the messages are sent after changing the sending number to a random number in order to send international SMS messages normally.

### Sending Policy
+ In countries with strict international SMS message policies such as China and Vietnam, messages can be sent normally only if the content of the sending message is a verification number (OTP).
+ To send messages properly, it is recommended to enter the verification number (OTP) as follows. (Example: Your verification code is 00000)
+ If you wish to send marketing messages, please contact the [Customer Center](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/support/inquiry) in advance.
+ To send international SMS messages normally, phrases of up to 12 characters may be added to messages according to country-specific policies, and the phrases are included in the number of charged characters.
+ Overseas carriers generally only keep sending logs within 7 days, so it may be difficult to confirm the cause of non-receipt depending on the time of inquiry.
+ It may take some time to confirm the cause of non-receipt through overseas carriers, and may be difficult to determine the exact cause.
+ Transmission quality by country is affected by the network and infrastructure environment in that country and may differ from the domestic environment.

### Billing Policy
+ International SMS messages are charged based on successful data transmission from overseas carriers.
+ The device reception result means the success of data transmission to the overseas communication service provider, and may differ from the actual device reception result. Even if the actual user did not receive the message, it may still count towards billing.
+ International SMS can send long messages through the concat feature. In the case of a long message, you will be charged for the number of messages sent based on character count.
+ When concating messages, the number of characters is reduced while processing headers. 
+ The number of characters and concat standards follow the international SMS standards.
+ Even if the message is sent by concat, it may be received by the device in the form of several short messages rather than a long message, depending on the mobile carrier and device policy.
+ The number of charges per message can be checked with the messageCount field of the detailed inquiry from the console and the detailed inquiry api.

## Guide for Sending Speed Depending on the Size of MMS Attachments
+ When sending MMS, there may be a difference in the sending speed depending on the size of the attachments.
+ The larger the size of uploaded attachments is, the slower the sending speed and the update of reception result may become due to carrier's sending speed restrictions.
+ If you want faster delivery, we recommend that you make a request by reducing the size of attachments.

## Guide for sending contents according to character set
+ When received, messages included in EUC-KR normally appear the same as the contents sent.
+ When characters not included in EUC-KR are included in the title/body, the contents may appear as broken characters such as '?'.
     + Depending on the type of receiving device and carrier, the contents of the message may appear differently.
