```
ㆍIf a message is sent from falsified sender number, such circuit or service of the user shall be suspended until investigation on the corresponding issue is completed.
  (Nevertheless, if such falsification turns out to be made by mistake, without malicious purposes, service may be resumed upon user's calling and evaluation.)
ㆍService shall be restricted if the user's system is designed to send messages also from other numbers, as well as registered sender numbers.
ㆍDamages shall be claimed for all other losses incurred out of sender number falsification

## Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers
The 'Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers' service protects user's own phone number from potentially spoofed for criminal acts or spamming.

### Please Check
+ As a free service provided by each telecommunication provider (e.g. SKT, KT, LGU+, or MVNO providers), it only requires your agreement to get registered.
+ If your text delivery is confirmed as 'Failure' on the website, even after it is sent to an appropriate number, see if your 'Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers' service is enabled.
+ Disable 'Filter Messages from Spoofed Numbers' first, and then try sending your message.
+ It takes about 7 days to get disabled after it is applied.

## Filter Spams by Telecommunication Providers
+ The service is provided by each telecommunication provider to automatically block annoying spams.
+ Texts considered as spams, by each provider's criteria, are sent to Spam Inbox, instead of Message Inbox.

### Please Check
+ If your delivery result is confirmed as successful but message is still not received, see if your Filter Spams service is enabled.
+ In accordance with the comprehensive measures set by the Anti-Spam Center of Korea Internet & Security Agency, each telecommunication provider provides 'Spam-Filtering' service.
+ If your message is saved at Spam Inbox, instead of Messages Inbox, disable the spam-filtering service first.
+ Due to policy to protect personal information, no one else but you must enable or disable the service.

### Unsubscribing 080 Numbers
+ With Unsubscribe 080 Numbers, recipients can reject receiving ad messages.
+ Ads must be sent along with how to unsubscribe for free, so that recipients can reject or withdraw consent to receiving ads, without a charge.

### Please Check
+ Charges for Unsubscribe 080 Numbers are not based on the delivery time, but upon the public release of each number (monthly fixed charges).
+ It takes about 3 to 4 days to get a new number for unsubscription, so one-off or repetitive service cancellation or application is not recommended.
+ Please note that a service opening cannot be cancelled while registration is reserved.
+ If you want to use the registered 080 call rejection number in other projects, you can use the **Share the blocked 080 phone numbers** feature.
+ 080 numbers that are cancelled from unsubscription or applied externally, delivery shall fail.

## Guide to Sending International SMS Messages
+ When sending international SMS messages, please check the following key points.
### Country-specific Sender ID Policy
+ International SMS messages are sent according to country-specific sender ID policies and may be treated as spam if you do not follow the sender ID policies.
+ The sending number set by the customer is not guaranteed to be exposed on the receiving device. In most cases, the messages are sent after changing the sending number to a random number in order to send international SMS messages normally.
### Message Sending Policies for Certain Countries
+ In countries with strict international SMS message policies such as China and Vietnam, messages can be sent normally only if the content of the sending message is a verification number (OTP).
### Billing Policy
+ International SMS messages are charged based on successful data transmission from overseas carriers.
+ The device reception result means successful data transmission to overseas carriers and may differ from the result of arriving at the actual device. Even if real users are not receiving the message, they may be included in the billing target.
+ It may take some time to check the reason for 'Not received' through the overseas carriers, and it may be difficult to confirm the exact reason.
+ The transmission quality for each country is greatly affected by the network and infrastructure environment of the country, and the transmission quality may differ from the domestic environment.

## Guide for Sending Speed Depending on the Size of MMS Attachments
+ When sending MMS, there may be a difference in the sending speed depending on the size of the attachments.
+ The larger the size of uploaded attachments is, the slower the sending speed and the update of reception result may become due to carrier's sending speed restrictions.
+ If you want faster delivery, we recommend that you make a request by reducing the size of attachments.
