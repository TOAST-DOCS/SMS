![sms_03_20230818](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_sms/eng/SMS_03_20230818.png)

## Sending SMS
* The maximum character count is based on storage. To avoid character truncation, write to a standard size, not a maximum character count.
* Content standards
    * Domestic SMS 90 bytes (45 Korean characters, 90 English characters), Domestic LMS 2,000 bytes (1,000 Korean characters, 2,000 English characters), Domestic MMS 2,000 bytes (1,000 Korean characters, 2,000 English characters including images) 
    * International SMS UCS-2 335 characters, International SMS GSM-7bit 765 characters
* For MMS, images must be uploaded as files that meet the image attachment specifications.
    * MMS maximum size: Only files 1000\*1000 or smaller can be attached
    * MMS supported specifications: 300 KB or less per image, 800 KB total for 3 images or less/ Only .jpg, .jpeg files can be attached
* For international SMS, it is concatenated based on encoding and character count.
    * Concatenated message is a service that makes a message appear to be connected as one long text on the device, like an LMS in Korea, to overcome the limitation of the number of characters that can be sent in international SMS sending.
    * The Concatenated message feature is available depending on the number of characters in the body, encoding, and support from international mobile carriers. If concatenated message is not supported, the device may receive multiple short messages.
    * When a concatenated message is created, certain headers take up a number of bytes (around 6) to concatenate the message, slightly reducing the number of characters you can send. Billing is based on the number of concatenated messages.

* If you fail to send a text due to blocking the sender number, please check the 'Stolen Number Text Blocking Service'. [Go to the user guide](./sending-policy/#fraud-number)

        * **Minimum Count** is a threshold setting for the number of conversion rate collection requests sent for conversion rate-based blocking to occur.
            - You must send a minimum number of conversion rate collection requests for conversion rate-based blocking to occur. 
            - You can specify a minimum number of cases from 1 to 10,000.
        * **Time Range** is the time range setting for calculating the conversion rate. 
            - The conversion rate is calculated based on the number of collection requests sent, the number of conversions, and the conversion rate within that time range from the time of the request to send.

> [Caution]
Cases of international SMS abuse are increasing globally.
It is recommended to set the monthly limit and the country of origin only as much as necessary.
NHN Cloud is not responsible for any international SMS sent due to abuse.

### Alternative Characters Settings
* If the body/subject of the delivery request contains unsendable text, you can set it to be converted to sendable text.
* When the alternative characters setting is enabled, unsendable characters are converted to '?' and displayed.

### Set Duplicate Delivery
* By setting, duplicate messages may not be sent.
* When the duplicate delivery setting is blocked, delivery is processed as failure for same requests during specified period (unit:minute).
* The maximum available block time is 1 hour.
* A message is determined as duplicate by the following criteria:
    * Message type (SMS/LMS/MMS/AUTH), delivery type (general/mass/tag), sender number, recipient number, title, body, and attached file

### Limit Advertising Messages
* You can limit the sending time of advertising messages.
* Advertising messages will not be sent during the set time.
    * Ad limit start time can be set: 18:00~21:00
    * Ad limit end time can be set: 08:00~12:00
* Failure/re-delivery is possible depending on how the undelivered message is set up.

### Backup Settings
* Depending on the message retention period policy, you can back up sending history data that is older than 180 days.
* If you enter information about whether to back up messages, the file extension, and the storage to upload the file to, a file containing the backup date will be created in that storage.


## Statistical Event Key Settings
When registering an event key and sending with that key, you can collect statistical data by statistical event key./
Please refer to the [reference](./console-guide/#tag-uid) for the meaning of statistical event key terms.

![sms_36_20230818](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_sms/eng/SMS_36_20230818.png)

1. Click **Register Event Key** to set the data collection period.
2. Enter a name and detailed description for the statistical event key.
3. Click **Save** and the event key will be registered.

When the data collection period ends, it becomes inactive and no longer collects data.<br/>
**The end point of the data collection period can be modified if activated.**

### Tags and UID

#### Glossary
| Term           | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Tag      | A system for classifying UIDs. <br>By attaching multiple tags to UID, users can easily search and use UID information. |
| UID          | An ID (identifier) that identifies the user. <br>Multiple contacts can be registered in one UID and used for sending. |
| Contact | A place designated for contact. <br>In Notification, you can register contact information from three services: Push, Email, and SMS. <br>Push refers to a token, Email refers to an email address, and SMS refers to a phone number. |

#### Send using tags
This feature allows you to send a text message by selecting a tag instead of the phone number that is the recipient's information.

1. Register UID.
    - Register UID and one or multiple phone numbers in the **UID management** tab.
    - For more information, please refer to [UID Management](./console-guide/#uid-manage).
2. Register a tag.
    - Register tags in the **Manage Tags** tab.
    - For more information, please refer to [Manage Tags](./console-guide/#tag-manage).
3. Register UID in tag.
    - Register the UID to the tag registered in the **Manage Tags** tab.
4. Select a tag and send a text message.
    - In the **General Send** tab, select **Send Tag** instead of email address to register the tag.
    - The email is sent to the phone number of the UID registered in the tag.
    - For more information, please refer to [Sending messages using tags](./console-guide/#tag-send).

#### Relationship with tag features in other services
* If you are using Push or SMS services in the same project, you can use the tag and UID information used in Email together without re-registering.
* You can add additional contact information to the same UID through each service's console.

### Statistics Event Keys and Statistics

| Statistical Event Key | This is an event key used when you want to view statistics grouped into specific units. |
| statsId | Unique ID of the statistical event key. This value is mainly used when calling the API. |

#### If you want to extract statistics in specific units when sending a message
1. Register statistical event keys in the **statistical event key management** tab. If sending using the API, you must obtain the statistics ID (statsId) from this screen.
2. When sending a message from the console or to the API, you must also send the statistics event key.

    2-1. When sending from console
    - When sending a text message in the **Deliver SMS** tab, select the statistical event key.
    - After entering all message information, click the **Send** button.
    - You can check statistical information after a certain period of time in the **Statistics** tab.

    2-2. When sending via API
    - Enter the statsId obtained from the **statistics event key management** tab into the message transmission parameters.
    - You can check statistical information after a certain period of time in the **Statistics** tab.

### Data retention period
* Retains the sending history for the last 180 days in accordance with the data retention policy.
* The attachments used in services are retained for 7 days. After 7 days, they are deleted and cannot be retrieved.
* However, the attachments and evidential documents (communications service certificate) registered to a template are retained as long as the service is provided.
* Statistical data stores information from the last 90 days.
