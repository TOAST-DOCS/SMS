## Identity Verification
* In order to comply with the amendment of the Telecommunications Business Act, an enhanced sender number pre-registration system has been applied to the SMS service.
    * Only for members who joined after March 2, 2022
* To use the SMS service, you must go through identity verification, which basically requires mobile phone identity verification and additional documentation depending on your membership type.
    * If you don't verify your identity, all features other than the **Sender Number Pre-Registration** tab will be disabled.
* The name and phone number you enter when you sign up must match the information you enter when you verify your identity to be approved.
* **For individual members, only the owner of the organization can authenticate his or her identity.** NHN Cloud members invited to an organization/project created by an individual member or IAM members invited to an organization created by an individual member cannot authenticate their identity.
* Proof of employment can only be <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">documents with the date of issuance and a stamp.<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold"><br/>
Make sure you <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">mask (hide) the last 6 digits of your resident registration number<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold"> in your employment certificate. Example) 000000-0\*\*\*\*\**

## Sending SMS
* The maximum character count is based on storage. To avoid character truncation, write to a standard size, not a maximum character count.
* Content standard: Domestic SMS 90 bytes (45 Korean characters, 90 English characters) / Domestic MMS 2,000 bytes (1,000 Korean characters, 2,000 English characters) / International SMS UCS-2 335 characters / International SMS GSM-7bit 765 characters   
* For international SMS, it is concatenated based on encoding and character count.
    * Concatenated message is a service that makes a message appear to be connected as one long text on the device, like an LMS in Korea, to overcome the limitation of the number of characters that can be sent in international SMS sending.
    * The Concatenated message feature is available depending on the number of characters in the body, encoding, and support from international mobile carriers. If concatenated message is not supported, the device may receive multiple short messages.
    * When a concatenated message is created, certain headers take up a number of bytes (around 6) to concatenate the message, slightly reducing the number of characters you can send. Billing is based on the number of concatenated messages.

* If you fail to send a text due to blocking the sender number, please check the 'Stolen Number Text Blocking Service'. [Go to the user guide](./sending-policy/#fraud-number)
* If the sending is successful but you do not receive the text, please check ‘Mobile Carrier Spam Blocking Service’. [Shortcut to guide](./sending-policy/#spam-number)
